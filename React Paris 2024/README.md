## Better, Faster, Stronger Web UI

By **Una Kravets**

> The web platform has evolved massively in the past few years, especially in the UI space. In this talk, learn how to take advantage of new and upcoming web platform features to lower your script payload and let the browser take on state management and accessibility hooks. Learn about upcoming features like view transitions, CSS-only scroll-driven animations, native stateful popovers, as well as new primitives like nesting that could significantly reduce file size. This talk will help you level up your developer skillset and open your eyes to new ways to build web UIs.
